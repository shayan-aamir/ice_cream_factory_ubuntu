Ice Cream Factory Management System – Operating Systems Project

• Tools: C, POSIX Threads, Parallel Programming • Simulated a multi-process ice cream factory using POSIX threads to model workers, machines, and logistics • Demonstrated parallel programming concepts by managing concurrent tasks like mixing, freezing, and packaging • Implemented thread synchronization using mutexes and semaphores to ensure resource safety and prevent race conditions • Showcased efficient task division and improved production flow through multithreading
